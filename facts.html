      <h4>What is Alzheimer's disease?</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Most common form of dementia - the cognitive decline in brain functions, such as memory and judgment, to the point where it interferes with daily life
</li>
          <li>Progressive disease that destroys brain functions, beginning with the loss of memory and thinking skills to eventually the loss of communication and movement
</li>
          <li>Injured neurons and brain cells in the brain, cutting off connections and eventually causing areas of the brain to shrink
</li>
          <li>Loss of brain functions lead to other problems within the body such as malnutrition or infections, which eventually lead to death
</li>
          <li>There is currently no cure, but there is medication to temporarily slow symptoms</li>
        </ul>

      <h4>What causes Alzheimer’s?</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Scientists do not have a full answer</li>
          <li>A variety of factors that can lead to increased risk are:
            <ol>
              <li>Age</li>
              <li>Genetics</li>
              <li>Lifestyle</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ul>
      <p>Research has shown that preserving a healthy lifestyle (nutritious diet and exercise) can reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s as well as other diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.</p>

      <h4>Common Misconceptions:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Alzheimer’s is just memory loss and is not fatal
          <ul>
            <li>No one has survived this disease. Alzheimer’s disease destroys brain cells and slowly prevents a person from performing daily life functions. </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>There are enough funds for Alzheimer’s research
          <ul><li>As shown in the graph, Alzheimer’s research does not receive enough funding compared to research for other chronic diseases.</li></ul>
